## Execution instructions

This is a specialized web crawler, designed to crawler only on the data in [http://freemanmoore.net](http://freemanmoore.net). It will output all crawled data(information of pages) to `all_pages.xlsx` file, a term-document frequency matrix to `frequencyMatrix.xlsx`, a postings lists to `postingslists.xlsx`, and **the** list of special crawled links(going out links, non-text files links, broken links, duplicated links) to a 'otherList.txt' file.

After that, you will be able to enter multiple queries, consisting of one or more query words separately by space. Entering "stop" will cause this program to stop.

Can follow the following instructions to execute this program:

1. Simply run 'Main.py'
2. Waiting for the console print "Query?"
3. Then you can enter a query.
4. After the results are displayed, you can continue enter the next query, or enter "stop"
